|console-logo| Console
======================
The glu console is a web application that offers a graphical presentation on top of the :doc:`orchestration engine <orchestration-engine>`.

Console in action
-----------------
The best way to get a feel of what the console looks like and what can be achieved, take a look at the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

Installation
------------
The :ref:`distribution generation <easy-production-setup-gen-dist>` phase generates a full web application container (jetty) that is ready to be used.

.. _console-as-a-server:

Console as a server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply follow :ref:`easy-production-setup-install` in order to install the server that was generated for you.

.. tip::
   This is the recommended way for deploying the console.

.. _console-as-a-war:

Console as a war
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to deploy the console in another web container then do the following:

 * generate the :ref:`distributions <easy-production-setup-gen-dist>` the normal way
 * then create the war file manually::

    cd <outputFolder>/consoles/org.linkedin.glu.console-server-<version>/
    cd glu/repository/exploded-wars/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp-<version>/
    jar cfm /tmp/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp-<version>.war META-INF/MANIFEST.MF *

 * make the configuration file that was generated (``<outputFolder>/consoles/org.linkedin.glu.console-server-<version>/glu-console-webapp.groovy``) available to your application server by using one of the following 3 techniques

  1. store it under ``$HOME/.org.linkedin.glu/glu-console-webapp.groovy``
  2. store it under ``conf/glu-console-webapp.groovy`` (relative to wherever the VM ``user.dir`` is set to)
  3. pass a system property ``-Dorg.linkedin.glu.console.config.location=/fullpath/to/file`` (or use the ``JAVA_OPTIONS`` environment variable)

.. _console-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The console is configured by defining the proper parameters (``configTokens``) in the :ref:`meta model <meta-model-console>` or providing the proper ``config-templates`` for more control.

.. note::
   All code examples (unless noted otherwise) are showing extracts of the meta model.

Console <-> Agent Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The console (orchestration engine) talks to all the agents using a REST api over https (or http if you do disable security). If you define a set of keys for the fabric hosted by the console, then the communication will happen over https, otherwise it will happen over http::

  // enable https communication
  def keys = [ 
     ...
  ]

  // disable https communication
  // def keys = null 

  fabrics["myFabric"] = [
    keys: keys,
    console: 'myConsole',
    ...
  ]

  consoles << [
    name: 'myConsole',
    ...
    ],
  ]

.. warning:: 
   Disabling the secure connection means that the agents will happily serve any request irrelevant of where it is coming from, which could be a serious security hole and as result is not recommended!

Plugins
^^^^^^^

The console (orchestration engine) behavior can be tweaked and or enhanced with the use of plugins. Check the :ref:`goe-plugins` section for details on how to create and install a plugin. 

.. warning:: 
   Since 4.1.0, *restricting file access on an agent* has been migrated to the ``StreamFileContentPlugin`` plugin and is now being configured by defining the properties::

     consoles << [
        name: 'myConsole',
        ...,
        configTokens: [
          plugins: """
     // path to the root of the unrestricted location (empty means no restriction)
     // this property is used by StreamFileContentPlugin
     plugins.StreamFileContentPlugin.unrestrictedLocation = ""

     // role for unrestricted
     plugins.StreamFileContentPlugin.unrestrictedRole = 'ADMIN'
          """
        ]
     ],


.. _console-configuration-database:

Database
^^^^^^^^

The console uses a database to store some of its data (like the audit log, user information, etc...). The built-in database that comes bundled with glu is `HSQLDB <http://hsqldb.org/>`_. The default location of the database is under the ``database/prod`` folder at the root of the jetty server. You may want to change this location by modifying the following section in the configuration file::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        dataSource: """
   dataSource.dbCreate = "update"
   dataSource.url = "jdbc:hsqldb:file:/path/to/database;shutdown=true"
        """
      ]
   ],

.. warning::
   It is not recommended to use the HSQLDB database in a real production environment. Please consider using another database like MySql (see next section).

.. _console-configuration-database-mysql:

Example for a different database: MySql
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Here are the steps to follow in order to use MySql instead of HSQLDB (the steps would be very similar for a different database!)

* Download and install MySql on your system (don't forget to start it!)

* Connect to MySql and create the ``glu`` user::

    sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
    mysql> create database glu;
    mysql> show databases;
    mysql> create user 'glua'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
    mysql> grant all on glu.* to 'glua'@'localhost';

  .. warning:: This values are obviously just example values (they simply need to be plugged in the right place in the configuration file (see below)).

* Edit the meta model in this fashion::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      dataSourceDriverUri: 'http://jcenter.bintray.com/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.25/mysql-connector-java-5.1.25.jar',
      configTokens: [
        dataSource: """
   def dataSourceUrl = "jdbc:mysql://hostWhereMySqlIsRunning/glu"
   dataSource.dbCreate = "update"
   dataSource.url = dataSourceUrl
   dataSource.logSql=false // set to true for details (+ open trace logging level)
   dataSource.dialect = "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect"
   dataSource.driverClassName = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
   dataSource.username= "glua" // this is from the glu user creation step
   dataSource.password = "password" // this is from the glu user creation step
        """
      ]
    ],

.. tip::
   You may want to check the quick production meta model that comes bundled with glu as it demonstrates the configuration steps.

* Start the console

* You can check that MySql is being used::

    mysql> use glu;
    mysql> show tables;
    +---------------------+
    | Tables_in_glu       |
    +---------------------+
    | audit_log           |
    | db_current_system   |
    | db_deployment       |
    | db_system_model     |
    | db_user_credentials |
    | fabric              |
    | role                |
    | user                |
    | user_permissions    |
    | user_role           |
    +---------------------+

.. note:: If you are experiencing the following issue with 
          MySql::

            2012/04/25 10:08:30.344 ERROR [JDBCExceptionReporter] The last packet successfully received 
            from the server was 73,329,213 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the 
            server was 73,329,214 milliseconds ago. is longer than the server configured value of 
            'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity 
            before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client 
            timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid 
            this problem

          it has been `reported <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/141>`_ that in order to fix the issue, you can add the following configuration properties
          file::

            dataSource.properties.validationQuery = "SELECT 1"
            dataSource.properties.testWhileIdle = false
            dataSource.properties.timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 1800000
            dataSource.properties.minEvictableIdleTimeMillis = 1800000
            dataSource.properties.numTestsPerEvictionRun = 3
            dataSource.properties.testOnBorrow = true
            dataSource.properties.testOnReturn = false

.. _console-configuration-database-other:

Other databases: Oracle, PostgresSQL
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Some databases (like Oracle and PostgresSQL) do not allow to have a table named ``USER``. In order to use one of this database, you need to add the following property to the glu configuration file (``console-server/conf/glu-console-webapp.groovy``)::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        dataSource: """
   ... // dataSource configuration goes here
   console.datasource.table.user.mapping = "db_user"
        """
      ]
   ],

Logging
^^^^^^^

The log4j section allows you to configure where and how the console logs its output. It is a DSL and you can view more details on how to configure it directly on the `grails web site <http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/guide/3.%20Configuration.html#3.1.2%20Logging>`_. If you want to provide your own log4j configuration simply edit the following section::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        log4j: """
   {
      appenders {
       file name:'file',
       file:'logs/console.log',
       layout:pattern(conversionPattern: '%d{yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %p [%c{1}] %m%n')
      }
    ... etc ...
   }
        """
      ]
   ],

.. note:: This has nothing to do with the audit log!

.. _console-configuration-ldap:

LDAP
^^^^

You can configure LDAP for handling user management in the console. See :ref:`console-user-management` for details. Here is the relevant section in the configuration file::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        ldap: """
   ldap.server.url="ldaps://ldap.acme.com:3269"
   ldap.search.base="dc=acme,dc=com"
   ldap.search.user="cn=glu,ou=glu,dc=acme,dc=com"
   ldap.search.pass="helloworld"
   ldap.username.attribute="sAMAccountName"
        """
      ]
   ],

.. _console-configuration-security-levels:

Security Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define your own security level (`USER`, `RELEASE` or `ADMIN`) per URL by defining a property like this::

  console.security.roles.'<path>' = '<role>'

You can define your own security level (`USER`, `RELEASE` or `ADMIN`) per REST call by defining a property like this::

  console.security.roles.'<method>:<path>' = '<role>'

Here are some examples::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        security: """
   // a URL for the web interface
   console.security.roles.'/model/load' = 'USER'

   // a REST call
   console.security.roles.'POST:/rest/v1/$fabric/model/static' = 'RELEASE'
        """
      ]
   ],

.. note:: You can check the `Config <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/blob/master/console/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy>`_ file for an exhaustive list of all the URLs and REST calls.

.. tip:: 
   If you have more than one entry to change, you can use a simpler notation::

     consoles << [
        name: 'myConsole',
        ...,
        configTokens: [
          security: """
     console.security.roles.putAll([
       '/agents/kill/$id/$pid': 'ADMIN',
       '/plan/execute/$id': 'ADMIN',
       '/plan/filter/$id': 'ADMIN'
     ])
          """
        ]
     ],

.. tip:: You can customize or bypass entirely the way glu handles security by implemeting your own :ref:`plugin <goe-plugins>`

Tuning
^^^^^^

Deployments auto-archive
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The plans page displays the list of deployments that have happened recently. Since 3.3.0, items in this list are automatically archived after 30 minutes. You can tune this property or simply disable automatic archiving by adding the following property::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        tuning: """
   // set it to "0" if you want to disable auto archiving entirely
   console.deploymentService.autoArchiveTimeout = "30m"
        """
      ]
   ],

.. _console-configuration-limiting-parallel-steps:

Limiting the number of parallel steps
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When running deployments in parallel, there is, by default, no limitation on how many steps can be executed at the same time. Depending on the size of your system, this may put a lot of stress on your infrastructure (like the network, binary repositories, etc...). In order to limit how many steps can run in parallel, you set it this way::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        tuning: """
   // The following property limits how many (leaf) steps get executed in parallel during a deployment
   // By default (undefined), it is unlimited
   console.deploymentService.deployer.planExecutor.leafExecutorService.fixedThreadPoolSize = 500
        """
      ]
   ],

.. _console-configuration-session-timeout:

Session timeout
"""""""""""""""

You can change the session timeout by defining the following property (and as the name of the property implies, you need to provide the value in minutes)::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        sessionTimeoutInMinutes: 60 // 1 hour
      ]
   ],

Plan
^^^^

Skipping missing agents
"""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, a missing agent generates a noop entry in the plan, or in other words it is skipped when the plan runs. If you want to change this behavior and generate an entry (which will fail on execution), then change the following property to ``false``::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        misc: """
   // set to false if you want missing agents to not be skipped anymore in plan computation
   console.plannerService.planner.skipMissingAgents = true
        """
      ]
   ],


UI configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The UI is configured in the ``console.defaults`` section of the configuration file. It is a simple map::

  console.defaults = 
  [
    ... configuration goes here ...
  ]

In order to use your own values, you can either provide (in the meta model) your entire ``console.defaults`` section::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        'console.defaults': """
   [
     ... configuration goes here ...
   ]
        """
      ]
   ],


or simply override specific values::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        'console.defaults.override': """
   console.defaults.customCss = ...
   console.defaults.dashboardAgentLinksToAgent = true
   ...
        """
      ]
   ],

.. note::
   The following sections will simply call out the specific entries within the ``console.defaults`` map, but you can use either method to change them.

.. _console-configuration-custom-css:

Custom Css
""""""""""

If you want to customize the look and feel of the console and override or tweak any css value, you can provide your own custom css. Possible values are ``null`` (or simply non existent), ``String`` or ``URI``::

      // no custom css
      customCss: null

      // as a String (using groovy """ notation makes it convenient)
      customCss: """
        .OK {
          background: green;
        }
      """

      // as a URI (for security reasons should be local!)
      customCss: new URI("/glu/repository/css/custom.css")

.. tip::
   Since 5.1.0 there is also another way to entirely change the css files. Check the :ref:`console-further-customizations` section.

Default Dashboard
"""""""""""""""""
See the :ref:`section <console-default-dashboard>` on how to configure the ``dashboard`` section of the configuration file.

Tags
""""

You can specify the colors of each tag (foreground and background)::

    tags:
    [
      '__default__': [background: '#005a87', color: '#ffffff'],
      'webapp': [background: '#ec7000', color: '#fff0e1'],
      'frontend': [background: '#006633', color: '#f1f5ec'],
      'backend': [background: '#5229a3', color: '#e0d5f9'],
    ],

.. note:: the ``__default__`` entry is optional and specify the color of the tags that are not specifically defined

.. note:: the color value (ex: ``#005a87``) ends up being used in css so you can use whatever is legal in css (ex: ``red``)

Model
"""""

The model page displays a summary and the columns are configurable in the following section::

      model:
      [
         agent: [name: 'agent'],
        'tags.webapp': [name: 'webapp'],
         'metadata.container.name': [name: 'container'],
         'metadata.product': [name: 'product'],
         'metadata.version': [name: 'version'],
         'metadata.cluster': [name: 'cluster']
      ]

This configuration results in the following output:

.. image:: /images/configuration-system-600.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Model display configuration

``model`` is a map with the following convention:

* the key represent the :term:`dotted notation` of an entry (see: :ref:`goe-filter-syntax` for more details and examples on the dotted notation)
* the value is a map with (currently) one entry only: ``name`` which represents the (display) name of the column

.. note:: Since 3.3.0, it takes effect only when showing a single model: for performance reasons the page which shows the list of models no longer fetches the model and as such cannot display this information

.. _console-configuration-non-editable-model:

Non Editable Model
""""""""""""""""""

You can enable or disable the fact that a system model is editable or not by changing the following property::

     disableModelUpdate: false,

By default, the model is editable which means that there is a ``Save Changes`` button and the text area containing the body is editable. Changing this value to ``true`` removes the button and makes the text area non editable anymore.

.. note:: Even if the model is not editable, it is always possible to *load* a new one by going to the ``Model`` tab. The idea behind this feature is to enforce the fact that the model should be properly versioned outside of glu and changing it should go through a proper flow that is beyond the scope of glu.

Shortcut Filters
""""""""""""""""

This entry allows you to define a dropdown that will be populated based on the model metadata in order to quickly set a filter. In the screenshot below, clicking on ``'product2:2.0.0'`` in the dropdown is equivalent to removing the current filter on ``product1`` and adding a new one for ``product2`` simplifying going back and forth between globally used concepts (like teams or product lines or zones, etc...)::

      shortcutFilters:
      [
          [
              name: 'product',
              source: 'metadata.product',
              header: ['version']
          ]
      ]

This configuration results in the following output:

.. image:: /images/shortcut-filters.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Shortcut filters

The format of this entry is an array of maps (so you can have more than one!) where each map consists of:

* a ``name`` entry which will be displayed in the dropdown when no filter entry is selected ``All [<name>]``
* a ``source`` which represents a :term:`dotted notation` of which data to use in the model. The data in the model should have the following structure:

  * the key is the value of the filter
  * the value is another map with the following convention:

    * ``name`` is the display name of the value (in this example they are the same!)
    * other entries that are used in the ``header`` section (see below)

* a ``header`` entry which is an array for extra information referring to entries in the metadata (see above)

Example of model which produces the previous screen::

  "metadata": {
    "product": { <================ value as defined in the model section (name: 'product')
      "product1": { <============= first entry (value for the filter!)
        "name": "product1", <===== display name of the value
        "version": "1.0.0"  <===== extra info as defined in the model section (header: ['version'])
      },
      "product2": { <============= second entry (value for the filter!)
        "name": "product2", <===== display name of the value
        "version": "2.0.0"  <===== extra info as defined in the model section (header: ['version'])
      }
    }
  }

Header
""""""

This entry allows you to add more information to the header in the console::

      header:
      [
          metadata: ['drMode']
      ]

This entry simply contains a ``metadata`` section which is an array of keys in the :term:`metadata` of the model (**not** of an entry).

Example of model::

  "metadata": {
    "product": {...},
    "drMode": "primary"
 }

The previous model and ``header`` configuration produce the following output:

.. image:: /images/configuration-header.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Header configuration

.. tip:: Since every fabric has its own model, hence its own ``metadata`` section, this feature is a convenient way to display fabric specific information. In this example we can display which fabric represents the primary data center versus which one represents the secondary data center.

Dashboard Agent Links
"""""""""""""""""""""

By default (new since 4.0.0), a link to an agent name in the dashboard has the same effect as all other links on the dashboard: it adds a filter. In this case it filters the model to see only the entries on this specific agent. The top level ``'Agents'`` tab allows you to navigate to the agent view. If you want to turn this off (thus reverting to the behavior prior to 4.0.0) use this entry (``dashboard`` section of the configuration file)::

      dashboardAgentLinksToAgent: true

.. _console-configuration-plans:

Plans
"""""

This (optional) entry allow you to configure what gets displayed in the table when you select the ``Plans`` subtab. Example (using the custom state machine as defined in the `Defining your own state machine <glu-script-state-machine>`_ section)::

    plans: [
      [planType: "deploy"],
      [planType: "redeploy"],
      [planType: "undeploy"],
      [planType: "transition", displayName: "* -> s1", state: "s1"],
      [planType: "transition", displayName: "* -> NONE", state: "NONE"],
    ],

The *standard* plan types are: ``deploy``, ``redeploy``, ``undeploy``, ``bounce`` and ``transition`` (which requires a ``state`` attribute).

.. tip:: By using the :ref:`plugin hook <goe-plugins>` ``PlannerService_pre_computePlans`` you can add your own plan types!

.. _console-configuration-mountPointActions:

MountPoint actions
""""""""""""""""""

This (optional) entry defines the actions available for a given mountPoint on the agents page. Example (using the custom state machine as defined in the `Defining your own state machine <glu-script-state-machine>`_ section)::

    // - key is "state of the mountPoint" (meaning, if the state of the mountPoint is "<key>" then
    //   display the actions defined by the value)
    //   * The key "-" is special and is reserved for the actions to display when the state does
    //     not have an entry (in this example, everything besides running).
    //   * The key "*" is special and is reserved for the actions to display all the time.
    //
    // - value is a map defining what to do (ex: bounce, undeploy) as well as extra informations
    mountPointActions: [
      s2: [
        [planType: "transition", displayName: "s2 -> s1", state: "s1"],
        [planType: "transition", displayName: "s2 -> NONE", state: "NONE"],
      ],

      // all other states
      "-": [
        [planType: "transition", displayName: "Start", state: "s2"],
      ],

      // actions to include for all states
      "*": [
        [planType: "undeploy", displayName: "Undeploy"],
        [planType: "redeploy", displayName: "Redeploy"],
      ]
    ],

The *standard* plan types are: ``deploy``, ``redeploy``, ``undeploy``, ``bounce`` and ``transition`` (which requires a ``state`` attribute).

.. tip:: By using the :ref:`plugin hook <goe-plugins>` ``PlannerService_pre_computePlans`` you can add your own plan types!

.. _console-configuration-tail:

Tail
""""

This section defines the default size and refresh rate (how long between polls) for the tail feature::

    tail: [
      size: '10k', // size to use when tailing a file by default (MemorySize)
      refreshRate: '5s' // how long between polls (Timespan)
    ],


.. _console-dashboard:

Features
""""""""

This section allows you to enable/disable certain features::

    features:
    [
      commands: true
    ],

* ``commands`` is the feature which allows you to run any kind of (unix/shell) command on an agent. You can disable this feature entirely in which case it will not be present in the UI at all.

    .. note:: This feature also has an agent side to it and it needs to be properly configured as well. Check the :ref:`agent configuration <agent-configuration>` section.

Commands
--------

If the ``commands`` feature is enabled, then you can configure what happens with the result (IO) of the command execution::

   consoles << [
      name: 'myConsole',
      ...,
      configTokens: [
        'console.defaults.override': """
   def commandsDir =
     System.properties['org.linkedin.glu.console.commands.dir'] ?: "${System.properties['user.dir']}/commands"
   
   // storage type supported right now are 'filesystem' and 'memory'
   console.commandsService.storageType = 'filesystem'
   
   // when storage is filesystem => where the commands are stored
   console.commandsService.commandExecutionIOStorage.filesystem.rootDir = commandsDir
   
   // when storage is memory => how many elements maximum to store (then start evicting...)
   console.commandsService.commandExecutionIOStorage.memory.maxNumberOfElements = 25
        """
      ]
   ],


.. note:: By default, the IO of a command is stored on the filesystem in a path structure that is like 
          this. This allows for easy maintenance!::

              .../commands/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<HH>/<z>/<commandId>/*

              Example:
              .../commands/2012/11/15/07/PST/13b0533729f-18c3a1e8-2a19-4291-a161-77155d9472ae/command.json
              .../commands/2012/11/15/07/PST/13b0533c29c-be265ce6-2d61-4502-acf8-978e18580cbe/command.json
              .../commands/2012/11/15/07/PST/13b0533f383-0f61f819-6a0f-4639-9695-8060a13799c4/command.json

Dashboard
---------

The dashboard is the main entry point of the console and is a visual representation of the :ref:`delta <goe-delta>`.

.. _console-dashboard-customization:
 
Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since 4.0.0, the dashboard can be customized by every user the way they see fit. Every user can also define as many `dashboards` as they want and the dropdown allows to switch between dashboard quickly.

.. image:: /images/console-dashboard-switch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Console dashboard

The easier way to create a new dashboard is to add filters and group by columns (by clicking on a column name) and then select ``'Save as new'``. The new dashboard can then be further customized by clicking on the ``'Customize'`` subtab which shows the definition of the dashboard as a json document::

  {
    "columnsDefinition": [
      {
        "groupBy": "uniqueCountOrUniqueVal",
        "linkable": true,
        "name": "cluster",
        "orderBy": "asc",
        "source": "metadata.cluster",
        "visible": true
      },
     ... etc ...
   ],
    "customFilter": "metadata.cluster='c1'",
    "errorsOnly": false,
    "name": "c1 cluster",
    "summary": false
  }

* ``name``: the name of the dashboard (will be displayed in the dropdown)
* ``errorsOnly``: to display only rows that are in error
* ``summary``: to display a summary view when there are more than one row with the same value (based on the first column). When this value is set to ``true`` then the ``groupBy`` entry of a column definition kicks in
* ``columnsDefinition`` is an array which defines each column. The order in the array defines in which order columns will be displayed so it is easy to move columns around by simply moving them in the array. Each column is defined this way:

  * ``name``: the name of the column as it appears in the dashboard
  * ``source``: which data in the model needs to be displayed using the :term:`dotted notation` (see: :ref:`goe-filter-syntax` for more details and examples on the dotted notation)
  * ``orderBy``: how to sort the column. Possible values are: ``asc / desc / null`` (``null`` means ignore for sorting purposes)
  * ``groupBy``: how to group rows when using a ``summary`` view. Possible values are: ``uniqueVals / uniqueCount / uniqueCountOrUniqueVal / vals / count / min / max``
  * ``linkable``: whether a link to add a filter should be displayed
  * ``visible``: whether the column should be visible at all (useful mostly internally for derived values)

.. _console-default-dashboard:

Default Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a user logs in the first time it is assigned a `default` dashboard. This dashboard is defined in the configuration file under the ``defaults.dashboard`` section and can be a json string or a simple groovy array of ``columnsDefinition`` as defined previously. This is the one that comes by default::

      dashboard:
      [
        [ name: "mountPoint", source: "mountPoint" ],
        [ name: "agent",      source: "agent"],
        [ name: "tags",       source: "tags",       groupBy: "uniqueVals"],
        [ name: "container",  source: "metadata.container.name"],
        [ name: "version",    source: "metadata.version"],
        [ name: "product",    source: "metadata.product"],
        [ name: "cluster",    source: "metadata.cluster"],
        [ name: "status",     source: "status" ],
        [ name: "statusInfo", source: "statusInfo", groupBy: "vals", visible: false],
        [ name: "state",      source: "state",                       visible: false]
      ]

.. _console-further-customizations:

Further customizations
----------------------
The console is distributed as an exploded war file. As a result it is possible to customize the console further like entirely replacing css files, images and javascript. To do so, you use the :ref:`glu-config-config-templates` concepts.

* 1. Create a directory structure::

       config-templates/console-server/glu/repository/exploded-wars/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp-@consoleMetaModel.version@/

  .. note:: the ``@`` sign in the directory name is not an error. It is a replacement token that is processed during the distribution phase.

* 2. This gives you access to the root of the webapp with 3 essential folders: ``css``, ``images`` and ``js``. Simply put your :ref:`templates <glu-config-templates>` in the proper subfolder.

* 3. Run the setup tool with the ``--config-templates-root`` option.

For example, if you wanted to change the glu logo with your own logo::

  # create directory structure
  mkdir -p /tmp/myFolder/config-templates/console-server/glu/repository/exploded-wars/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp-@consoleMetaModel.version@/images
  # copy your logo with the proper name
  cp <my logo>.png /tmp/myFolder/config-templates/console-server/glu/repository/exploded-wars/org.linkedin.glu.console-webapp-@consoleMetaModel.version@/images/glu_480_white.png
  # run the setup tool
  $GLU_HOME/bin/setup.sh -D -o xxxx --config-templates-root "<default>" --config-templates-root /tmp/myFolder/config-templates my-model.json.groovy

.. _console-script-log-files:

Log Files Display
-----------------

When looking at an agent (agents view page), for each entry, there may be a log section determined by the fields declared in the script:

.. image:: /images/console-script-log-files.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Script log files

In order to see an entry like this you can do the following in your script:

* declare any field which ends in ``Log`` (ex: ``serverLog``)
* declare a field called ``logsDir`` (pointing to a folder) which will display the ``more...`` link
* declare a field called ``logs`` and of type ``Map`` where each entry will point to a log file

Example of glu script::

    class GluScriptWithLogs
    {
      def logsDir
      def serverLog
      def logs = [:]

      def install = {
        logsDir = shell.toResource("${mountPoint}/logs")
        serverLog = logsDir."server.log" // using field with name ending in Log
        logs.gc = logsDir."gc.log" // using logs map
      }
    }

.. _console-script-pids:

Processes Display
-----------------

When looking at an agent (agents view page), for each entry, there may be a ``Processes`` section determined by the fields declared in the script:

.. image:: /images/console-script-log-files.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Script log files

or in the ``All Processes`` tab, the ``org.linkedin.app.name`` column can provide details about the process:

.. image:: /images/console-script-processes.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Script log files

In order to see entries like this you can do the following in your script:

* declare a field called ``pids`` which should be a map where the key is the pid (process id) and the value is another map with the following keys:

  * ``command``: the name of the command/process (ex: ``java``) (optional)
  * ``org.linkedin.app.name``: the name to be displayed (optional)
  * ``cpu``: the percentage of cpu used by the process (optional). This value is usually unnecessary to be provided since glu will compute it appropriately.

* declare a field called ``pid`` which is just one process id and will reference the "main" process started by the glu script (and will be rendered as a ``ps`` shortcut).

Example of glu script::

    class GluScriptWithPids
    {
      def port
      def pid
      def pids

      // ...

      def start = {
        shell.exec("${serverCmd} start > /dev/null 2>&1 &")

        // we wait for the process to be started (should be quick)
        shell.waitFor(timeout: '5s', heartbeat: '250') {
          pid = isProcessUp()
          // in order for groovy/glu to detect the changes inside the map, the entire map should be
          // recreated every time (simply treat it as an immutable map...)
          pids =
            [
              (pid): [ 'org.linkedin.app.name': "Jetty container [${port}]" ]
            ]
        }
      }

      // ...

      private Integer isProcessUp()
      {
        // determine if the process is up or not and return the pid
        // ...
        return processId
      }

    }


.. note:: In order to fill the ``org.linkedin.app.name`` column, you can also simply start the process with a command line argument like this: ``-Dorg.linkedin.app.name=xxx`` and ``xxx`` will be displayed (note that the ``pids`` map in the glu script will override this value if both are provided).

.. tip:: For a full example, check the ``JettyGluScript`` that comes bundled with glu.

First bootstrap
---------------
The very first time the console is started, it will create an admin user. Log in as this user::

    username: admin
    password: admin

Then click on the ``'admin'`` tab (not the one called ``'Admin'``) and click ``'Manage your credentials'``.

.. warning:: It is strongly recommended you immediately change the admin password!

.. _console-user-management:

User management
---------------
There are 2 ways to manage users.

LDAP
^^^^
If you define an ldap section in the configuration file (see :ref:`configuration section <console-configuration-ldap>` for details), then the console will automatically allow any user who has the correct ldap credentials to login. If the user has never logged in before, a new account will be automatically created and the user will have the role ``USER`` which gives him read access mostly (and limited access to log files). This allows any user to login to the console without any administrator intervention.

Manual user management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whether you use LDAP or not you can always use this method. If you don't use LDAP then it is your only choice. On the ``Admin`` tab, you can create a new user by giving it a user name and a password. You can also assign roles to a user:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Role                |Description                                                             |
+====================+========================================================================+
|``USER``            |mostly read access (limited access to some log files (cannot go anywhere|
|                    |on the filesystem))                                                     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``RELEASE``         |most of the traditional release actions (like starting and stopping     |
|                    |entries…)                                                               |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``ADMIN``           |administrative role (create user, assign roles…)                        |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|``RESTRICTED``      |if you want to ban a user from the console                              |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: No matter what the role the user in, actions taken are logged in the audit log that can be viewed from the ``Admin`` tab.

Password management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Even if you use LDAP, a user can assign himself a console password (useful if the password needs to be stored in scripts for example).

Console tabs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Take a look at the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>` in order to get a feel for each tab.
